# 100daysMLchallenge

Learning something new with ML each day. The motive behind this repo is to spend 30 mins or more in an ML problem and learn something new. 

# Day 1
## 6 January 
> Dataset : Medical cost personal dataset
**Note:  Logs**
> - Using Logarithms: Logarithms helps us have a normal distribution which could help us in a number of different ways such as outlier detection, implementation of statistical concepts based on the central limit theorem and for our predictive modell in the foreseen future. 

# Day 2
## 7 January 
> Dataset : Medical cost personal dataset
**Note:  OLS and Hyppthesis Testing**
> - OLS is also known as the Ordinary Least Squares. It is a method to find a linear relation between the independent variable and dependent variable. 
> - In stats module ols is can be used to find the p value between the two. The p-value or the probability value is used to test the hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis which stands against the ruling hypothesis or the null hypothesis. 
> - The alternative hypothesis is the one you would believe if the null hypothesis is concluded to be untrue. The evidence in the trial is your data and the statistics that go along with it. All hypothesis tests ultimately use a p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence (what the data are telling you about the population). The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way:

>>      1. A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.
>>      2. A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
>>      3. p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.
